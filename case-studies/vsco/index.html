The team containerized the microservices using <a href=https://www.docker.com/>Docker</a>, but "they were all in separate groups of <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>EC2</a> instances that were dedicated per service," says Melinda Lu, Engineering Manager for the Machine Learning Team. Adds Naveen Gattu, Senior Software Engineer on the Community Team: "That yielded a lot of wasted resources. We started looking for a way to consolidate and be more efficient in the AWS EC2 instances."<h2>Solution</h2>The team began exploring the idea of a scheduling system, and looked at several solutions including Mesos and Swarm before deciding to go with <a href=https://kubernetes.io/>Kubernetes</a>. VSCO also uses <a href=https://grpc.io/>gRPC</a> and <a href=https://www.envoyproxy.io/>Envoy</a> in their cloud native stack.<br><h2>Impact</h2>Before, deployments required "a lot of manual tweaking, in-house scripting that we wrote, and because of our disparate EC2 instances, Operations had to babysit the whole thing from start to finish," says Senior Software Engineer Brendan Ryan. "We didn't really have a story around testing in a methodical way, and using reusable containers or builds in a standardized way." There's a faster onboarding process now. Before, the time to first deploy was two days' hands-on setup time; now it's two hours. By moving to continuous integration, containerization, and Kubernetes, velocity was increased dramatically. The time from code-complete to deployment in production on real infrastructure went from one to two weeks to two to four hours for a typical service. Adds Gattu: "In man hours, that's one person versus a developer and a DevOps individual at the same time." With an 80% decrease in time for a single deployment to happen in production, the number of deployments has increased as well, from 1200/year to 3200/year. There have been real dollar savings too: With Kubernetes, VSCO is running at 2x to 20x greater EC2 efficiency, depending on the service, adding up to about 70% overall savings on the company's EC2 bill. Ryan points to the company's ability to go from managing one large monolithic application to 50+ microservices with "the same size developer team, more or less. And we've only been able to do that because we have increased trust in our tooling and a lot more flexibility, so we don't need to employ a DevOps engineer to tune every service." With Kubernetes, gRPC, and Envoy in place, VSCO has seen an 88% reduction in total minutes of outage time, mainly due to the elimination of JSON-schema errors and service-specific infrastructure provisioning errors, and an increased speed in fixing outages.</div></div></section><div class=banner2><div class=banner2text>"I've been really impressed seeing how our engineers have come up with creative solutions to things by just combining a lot of Kubernetes primitives.

In the beginning, "we were using Rackspace and had one PHP monolith application talking to MySQL database, with FTP deployments, no containerization, no orchestration," says Software Engineer Brendan Ryan, "which was sufficient at the time."</h2>After VSCO moved to AWS in 2015 and its user base passed the 30 million mark, the team quickly realized that set-up wouldn't work anymore. Developers had started building some Node and Go microservices, which the team tried containerizing with Docker. But "they were all in separate groups of EC2 instances that were dedicated per service," says Melinda Lu, Engineering Manager for the Machine Learning Team. Adds Naveen Gattu, Senior Software Engineer on the Community Team: "That yielded a lot of wasted resources. We started looking for a way to consolidate and be more efficient in the EC2 instances."<br><br>With a checklist that included ease of use and implementation, level of support, and whether it was open source, the team evaluated a few scheduling solutions, including Mesos and Swarm, before deciding to go with Kubernetes. "Kubernetes seemed to have the strongest open source community around it," says Lu. Plus, "We had started to standardize on a lot of the Google stack, with Go as a language, and gRPC for almost all communication between our own services inside the data center.

"We had already begun breaking up the monolith, so we moved things one by one, starting with pretty small, low-risk services," says Lu. "Every single new service was deployed there." The first service was migrated at the end of 2016, and after one year, 80% of the entire stack was on Kubernetes, including the rest of the monolith.<br><br>The impact has been great.
